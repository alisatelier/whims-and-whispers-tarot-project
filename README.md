# Whims & Whispers Tarot Auto-Spread


The goal of this project is to develop a web-based application to streamline and enhance the process of conducting online tarot readings. The tool will allow a tarot reader (the admin) to input the client's question, select a tarot spread, search and assign cards to specific positions, and present the reading visually and interactively to the client.

### Core Features
#### Admin Dashboard (Reader's Side)
- Client Question Input

  - A form field to enter the question or intention the client has asked about.

  - Spread Selection
- Ability to choose from six predefined spread templates:

   -  Three 3-Card Spreads 

   -  Three 5-Card Spreads 

- Card Search & Assignment

  - A searchable tarot card database.

  - Ability to select and assign specific cards to specific positions in the chosen spread.


#### Client-Facing Display (Reading Interface)
- Dynamic Card Layout

  - Cards appear on-screen based on the selected spread (3 or 5 cards).

  - Each card is placed in its assigned position.

- Interactive Reveal
  - Cards are shown face-down initially.

  - Click to flip each card, one at a time.

- On flip, the card reveals:

    The card's image (upright or reversed).

    The card's meaning (pulled from the database)

- Ability to save/export the reading as a report and email to client.
